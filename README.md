# Pong Chaos

[My Notes](notes.md)

## Game Overview
This is a simple game in which the user will input their name to begin. After, the game begins and two balls starting bouncing off the walls, getting faster as they go. The player can control their character, moving around the area and will keep playing as long as they avoid the balls. Their score increases as the game continues, until the chracter is hit with the ball. Powerups periodically appear, temporarily slowing down the speed of the balls or increasing the speed of the player.

You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Everyone is familiar with the game pong. It's simple yet fun. But what if instead of hitting the ball, you needed to avoid it? And what if there is not one, but two balls to avoid? The chaos gets crazier when we throw in some powerups too! You absolutely can't miss out on this crazy adventure.

### Design

![Main Screen](images/mainscreen.jpg)

This is the main screen where the player will enter their name


![Game Screen](images/gamescreen.jpg)

This is where the game is played, until the player is hit by one of the balls


![High Score Screen](images/highscorescreen.jpg)

Here the high scores are shown


### Key features

- Name of player is stored
- Balls are bounced around at increasingly faster rates
- Powerups are randomly placed periodically
- Player controls character's movement
- When ball hits character, game is over
- Score is stored with name of player
- High scores are shown

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Has 3 different HTML pages. One for the main screen, one for the game itself, and one with the high scores. The high scores and main screen have links to each other.
- **CSS** - Easy to read font, nice and big. Preferably white, to keep a retro asthetic. With a black background. 
- **React** - Has a name box, balls that move and get faster. Character is controlled with arrow keys. 
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
-Storing high scores and names
-Login in with name
-Random fact
- **DB/Login** - Stores the 3 top high scores
- **WebSocket** - Anytime a user creates a new game
